        <p>Social networks capture people's attention, driven by attention seekers, heightened eccentricity, and egocentrism. Users become modern slaves to the platform, engaging with anti-bot mechanisms that require human interaction. The blue checkmark signifies a superior class of users, creating a division that enhances the ego and prestige of those who possess it. This continuously generated content competes for attention due to the monetization aspect—users create content to attract views and generate profit.</p><p><br></p><p>The passive aspect of social networks is the algorithm, which delivers tweets and content without user choice. The left tab defaults to "For you," but it is curated by an algorithm, not tailored to individual preferences. This algorithm is closed-source and lacks transparency, bombarding users with irrelevant content that does not match their interests or passions.</p><p><br></p><p>In contrast, traditional TV allows users to choose a channel and program, creating an expectation that the media may satisfy their interests. There is no algorithm that abruptly alters content without notice. Platforms like X have worsened this experience. Engaging with these networks requires constant attention—users must perpetually post and write tweets, racing to create the most captivating and sensational content.</p><p><br></p><p>The uncensored nature of digital content and news places the onus on users to discern the vast array of information available. The experience has changed dramatically, with attention-seeking individuals publishing striking and impressive content to maximize engagement. Consequently, audiences are bombarded with intense content, including violent videos and scenes from the streets, which they could never experience in real life. Spending a week on Twitter can equate to passively consuming a lifetime of live events, from terrorist attacks to protests, all vying for views, likes, and retweets, which inflate a false sense of personal clout.</p><p><br></p><p>What are the implications of this exposure? Has any generation been so inundated with facts at once? What effect does this have on the human psyche? Could it lead to increased social anxiety?</p><p><br></p><p>Users, often in a trance-like state due to fatigue, a state which is recognized as doomscrolling, where users are bombarded with content that they absorb to varying degrees. As a result, social anxiety and stress rise, with users becoming passive witnesses to an overwhelming amount of information that is difficult to digest all at once. This media content fosters fear and uncertainty within the digital populace. People grow more fearful of the real world, as their perception is shaped by the countless posts driven by an algorithm designed for engagement and monetization.</p><p><br></p><p>Furthermore, a new generation of individuals, such as YouTubers and so-called "social influencers," represents another facet of society's decline. Their primary goal is to attract views; they lack authenticity and operate as modern entertainers, using the tools provided by these platforms. Anyone can speak, stream, or create content, but they must excel to stand out. In doing so, they adopt the worst traits of this new fake culture generated by social networks like X.</p><p><br></p><p>Yet, the platform does host valuable users and good content within niches that are challenging to navigate unless one creates tailored lists or consistently engages with followed accounts. This discipline is not effective for the average user.</p><p><br></p><p>Furthermore, the platform can easily become polarized, largely due to figures like Elon Musk. For example, if he is fined, he tends to complain and rally his audience against the entity imposing the fine, attempting to discredit it. A notable instance is the EU case, where Musk was fined for misusing the blue checkmark; instead of addressing the fine, he framed the discussion as an "attack against freedom of speech." This platform poses dangers, especially when control and coercion can be exerted through various means, including government or authoritarian actions. Platforms are often manipulated before significant elections, and those with vested interests may intervene to further control media narratives and spread altered or partial truths.</p><p><br></p><p>Additionally, the platform does not prioritize searches or archival approaches; it focuses solely on the present. Finding meaningful information among this data is challenging. Bots operate based on sentiment and attempt to capture it, but they also face difficulties. Navigating the vast amount of content is hard because many tweets lack substantive content or consist of media that cannot be parsed through text searches. The search function remains basic and primitive for such an advanced platform, suggesting that the platform does not encourage extensive searching. Real data mining occurs internally, often at the users' expense; as the saying goes, "if it's free, you are the product." Furthermore, paid tiers are becoming a reality, and access to content is increasingly aggressive.</p><p><br></p><p>It is advisable to avoid such platforms unless you are a disciplined, methodical user capable of filtering much of the propagated content. Instead, consider reading a book, an article, practicing meditation, watching a good movie, listening to the radio or a podcast, or learning something new; you would do yourself a great favor.</p>
